Installation
============

There are two ways you can use pyradiomics:
1. Install via pip
2. Install from source

------------------
1. Install via pip
------------------

Pre-built binaries are available on PyPI for installation via pip. For the python versions
mentioned below, wheels are automatically generated for each release of ``multimodars``, allowing you to
install multimodars without having to compile anything.

* Ensure that you have ``python`` installed on your machine, version 3.12 or higher (64-bits).

* Install multimodars::

    python -m pip install multimodars

----------------------
2. Install from source
----------------------

multimodars can be installed from source with the following steps.

* Clone the repository and install Rust and Maturin::

    # Install rust in case you don't have it on your system
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

    git clone https://github.com/yungselm/multimoda-rs.git
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install maturin
    . "$HOME/.cargo/env" # Set rust env
    maturin develop

.. note::

   In case you get the following error::
    
    ðŸ’¥ maturin failed
    Caused by: rustc, the rust compiler, is not installed or not in PATH. 
    This package requires Rust and Cargo to compile extensions. Install it 
    through the system's package manager or via https://rustup.rs/.

   execute the following commands::

    unset -v VIRTUAL_ENV
    maturin develop
