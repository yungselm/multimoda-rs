1. Workflow csv files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After pip installing or locally building the package, install it in the familiar way.

.. code-block:: python

    import multimodars as mm

To run the whole workflow from .csv files the following requirements have to be met.
Files should be named ``diastolic_contours.csv``, ``systolic_contours.csv``, 
``diastolic_reference_points.csv`` and ``systolic_reference_points.csv`` depending on the required analysis.
Every file should be structured in the following way (no headers):

+-------+---------+---------+---------+
| ...   |   ...   |   ...   |   ...   |
+-------+---------+---------+---------+
| 771   | 2.4862  | 6.7096  | 24.5370 |
+-------+---------+---------+---------+
| 771   | 2.5118  | 6.7017  | 24.5370 |
+-------+---------+---------+---------+
| 771   | 2.5370  | 6.6936  | 24.5370 |
+-------+---------+---------+---------+
| ...   |   ...   |   ...   |   ...   |
+-------+---------+---------+---------+

To acquire meaningful measurement data, the coordinates should be provided in mm or another SI unit instead of pixel values.
Optionally a record file can be provided `combined_sorted_manual.csv`, which should have the following structure, here the first column should contain the desired frame order and "measurement_1" 
represent the thickness of the wall between aorta and coronary and "measurement_2" for the thickness between pulmonary artery and coronary (position just for demonstration). This is based on the 
output of the `AIVUS-CAA software <https://github.com/AI-in-Cardiovascular-Medicine/AIVUS-CAA/>`_:

+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| frame           | (position)    |   phase       | measurement_1 | measurement_2 |
+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 18              |  23.99        |       D       |               |               |
+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 37              |  22.79        |       D       |               |     2.35      |
+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 212             |  21.59        |       D       |     1.38      |     2.34      |
+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 94              |  20.39        |       D       |     1.38      |     2.11      |
+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
|  ...            |    ...        |     ...       |     ...       |     ...       |
+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 47              |  18.78        |       S       |               |               |
+-----------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

This simplifies the workflow, by just providing a directory to automatically process:

.. code-block:: python

    rest, stress, dia, sys, (rest_logs, stress_logs, dia_logs, sys_logs) = mm.from_file(
        mode="full",
        rest_input_path="rest_csv_files",
        stress_input_path="stress_csv_files",
        rest_output_path="output/rest",
        stress_output_path="output/stress",
    )

However the preferred more flexible way is from numpy arrays.

2. Workflow numpy arrays and Finetuning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here the geometry can be directly build from arrays with the same structure as before:

+------------+----------+----------+----------+
| ...        |   ...    |   ...    |   ...    |
+------------+----------+----------+----------+
| 771        | 2.4862   |  6.7096  |  24.5370 |
+------------+----------+----------+----------+
| 771        | 2.5118   |  6.7017  |  24.5370 |
+------------+----------+----------+----------+
| 771        | 2.5370   |  6.6936  |  24.5370 |
+------------+----------+----------+----------+
| ...        |   ...    |   ...    |   ...    |
+------------+----------+----------+----------+

catheter and walls are optional. However it is not recommended to provide the catheter points directly, but rather the image center (in mm), radius of the catheter (e.g. 0.5mm for IVUS)
and number of points to represent the catheter. If no walls are provided a default wall with 1mm offset is created.

.. code-block:: python

    prestent = mm.numpy_to_geometry(
        contours_arr=contours,
        catheters_arr=np.array([]),
        walls_arr=np.array([]),
        reference_arr=references,
    )

    poststent = mm.numpy_to_geometry(
        contours_arr=contours,
        catheters_arr=np.array([]),
        walls_arr=np.array([]),
        reference_arr=references,
    )

    pair, logs = mm.from_array(
        mode="singlepair",
        geometry_dia=prestent,
        geometry_sys=poststent,
        step_rotation_deg=0.1,
        range_rotation_deg=30,
        image_center=(4.5, 4.5),
        radius=0.5,
        n_points=20,
        write_obj=True,
        output_path="output/stent_comparison",
        interpolation_steps=28,
        bruteforce=False,
        sample_size=200,
    )

This ``from_array`` function automatically aligns the frames within a pullback and then between pullbacks. The algorithm translates contours to the same centroid as the most proximal contour,
and then finds the best rotation based on contour **AND** catheter points.

.. image:: ../paper/figures/Figure3.jpg
   :alt: Example figure
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

The number of catheter points (``n_points``) therefore influences how much weight is given to the original image center. For mostly round contours, where Hausdorff distances are similar in different angles,
this image center can increase accuracy of the correct rotation. For stenotic sections or coronary artery anomalies, where the vessel has distinct shape difference, this number can be kept
rather small (default 20 points compared to 500 for the contour).

``range_rotation_deg`` and ``step_rotation_deg`` define the +/- degree range where the rotation is tested (default 90° so full range) and step_rotation_deg in what step sizes (default 0.5°).
This algorithm is optimized and where it downsamples the original contour to 200 points, and performs coars steps (full provided range in 1° steps, then in +/- 5° degrees around the optimal angle
in 0.1° steps and so on until the desired acccuracy). If bruteforce is set to 'True' the complete range is sweeped with the provided acccuracy (not recommended O(n^3)).

If ``write_obj`` is set to True, geometries will be saved as .obj files. if interpolation steps are not 0, additionally interpolated geometries will be created. This is useful if the dynamic
behaviour will be rendered later on. For example here a rendering of a non-aligned systolic stress-induced deformation in a coronary artery anomaly:

.. image:: ../examples/figures/animation_stress_induced_systolic_deformation.gif
    :alt: Example figure
    :align: center
    :width: 400px

2. Alignment with a centerline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A centerline can be created directly from points. Points don't need any index, only x-, y- and z-coordinates:

+------------+------------+------------+
|     ...    |     ...    |     ...    |
+------------+------------+------------+
|   12.6579  |  -199.7824 |   1751.519 |
+------------+------------+------------+
|   13.0847  |  -200.3508 |   1751.8602|
+------------+------------+------------+
|   13.419   |  -200.9894 |   1752.1491|
+------------+------------+------------+
|     ...    |     ...    |     ...    |
+------------+------------+------------+

These could for example be stored in a .csv file and then be converted to a PyCenterline, which also includes the normals connecting the points:

.. code-block:: python

    cl_raw = np.genfromtxt("data/centerline_raw.csv", delimiter=",")
    centerline = mm.numpy_to_centerline(cl_raw)

As soon as the centerline is created it will be automatically resampled to have the same spacing as the
PyGeometry or PyGeometryPair, which will be aligned with the centerline.

This can either be done with three point alignment (preferred), where one point is corresponding to the reference point
of the PyGeometry (e.g. aortic reference for coronary artery anomalies) and one point indicating the superior position
and another point indicating the inferior position.

.. image:: ../examples/figures/Alignment3p.png
   :alt: Example figure
   :align: center
   :width: 400px

The reference contour is then best matched to these three points, all the leading points on the centerline are removed
and the spacing is adjusted to match the z-spacing of the PyGeometry.

.. code-block:: python

    aligned_pair, cl_resampled = mm.to_centerline(
        mode="three_pt",
        centerline=centerline,
        geometry_pair=rest,                # e.g. Rest geometry (dia/sys)
        aortic_ref_pt=(12.26, -201.36, 1751.06),
        upper_ref_pt=(11.76, -202.19, 1754.80),
        lower_ref_pt=(15.66, -202.19, 1749.97)
    )

3. Saving everything as .obj files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
While every wrapper function allows to directly save the created geometries as .obj files (with optional interpolation),
it is also possible to save any created geometry directly to an object file. The ``to_obj`` function can automatically
detect the type of the object, and can be applied to PyGeometryPair, PyGeometry. For PyCenterline use the ``centerline_to_obj`` function.

.. code-block:: python

    mm.to_obj(aligned_pair.dia_geom, "data/aligned.obj")
    mm.centerline_to_obj(cl_resampled, "data/resampled_cl.obj")

4. Utility functions to link to numpy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Any python object can be returned as numpy array, in case of PyGeometry and PyGeometryPair the different parts
will be returned as a dictionary with their corresponding arrays (contours, catheters, walls, reference):

.. code-block:: python

    stress_dia_arr, stress_sys_arr = mm.to_array(stress)
    aligned_arr = mm.to_array(aligned)
    centerline_arr = mm.to_array(cl_resampled)
    ostial_contour_arr = mm.to_array(rest.dia_geom.contours[-1])

Returns::

    np.ndarray
        For PyContour or PyCenterline:
        A 2D array of shape (N, 4), where each row is (frame_index, x, y, z).

    dict[str, np.ndarray]
        For PyGeometry:
        A dictionary with keys ["contours", "catheters", "walls", "reference"],
        each containing a 2D array of shape (M, 4), where M is the number of points in that layer.
        "reference" is a (1, 4) array or (0, 4) if missing.

    Tuple[dict[str, np.ndarray], dict[str, np.ndarray]]
        For PyGeometryPair:
        A tuple of two dictionaries (one for diastolic, one for systolic), each in the same format
        as returned for a single PyGeometry.

5. Reordering algorithm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Especially in intravascular ultrasound imaging breathing can lead to additional bulk movements of frames
due to relative catheter movement to the vessel. This can lead to complex patterns and the preferred solution
is with the Option<record>. In this case algorithms can also be manually controlled. However, ``multimodars``
additionally provides a reordering algorithm that works by creating a cost matrix of Hausdorff distances 
between all frames in the geometry.

.. code-block:: python

    rest.reorder(delta=0.0, max_rounds=5)

6. Class methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
PyContour
--------------
After creating a PyGeometry several utility methods provided. If a new contour is created from points
and no centroid is available it can easily be calculated, additionally can the closest opposite points
and the farthest points be identified:

.. code-block:: python

    contour.compute_centroid()
    (p1, p2), distance = contour.find_closest_opposite()
    (p1, p2), distance = contour.find_farthest_points()

For every contour the area and elliptic ratio can be returned. **CAVE:** units are calculated from the original
image spacing, if contours were provided in pixels no meaningful result will be returned.

.. code-block:: python

    area = contour.get_area()
    elliptic_ratio = contour.get_elliptic_ratio()

Contours can also be manipulated, however for additional safety operations are not performed in place
but rather return a new contour that can then be set to the original position if needed.

.. code-block:: python

    contour = geometry.contours[2]
    contour_rot = contour.rotate(20)
    contour_trsl = contour_rot.translate((0.0, 1.0, 2.0))
    geometry.set_cont(2, contour_trsl)

PyGeometry/PyGeometryPair
-------------------------
The PyGeometry has some additional functionality, contours inside can be smoothed with a
moving average and rotation and translation can be performed on Geometry level

.. code-block:: python

    geometry.smooth_contours(window_size=3)
    geom_rot = geometry.rotate(20)
    geom_trsl = geom_rot.translate((0.0, 1.0, 2.0))

Additionally there is a summary function to return minimal lumen area, maximum stenosis, and stenosis length in mm
as a tuple for either PyGeometry or PyGeometryPair. For PyGeometryPair additionally a map with lumen area and elliptic
ratio for either diastole and systole are provided. These results can then easily be translated to a numpy array.

.. code-block:: python

    geometries.get_summary()
    geometries.dia_geom.get_summary()
    geometries.sys_geom.get_summary()
    # turn summary map to numpy array
    _, deformation = geometries.get_summary()
    deform_array = np.array(deformation)

Returns::

    Geometry "Diastole":
    MLA [mm²]: 5.57
    Max. stenosis [%]: 58
    Stenosis length [mm]: 2.99

    Geometry "Systole":
    MLA [mm²]: 4.71
    Max. stenosis [%]: 69
    Stenosis length [mm]: 11.20
